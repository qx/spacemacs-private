;;; Synopsis
;;; ========
;;;
;;; Within an Org mode outline or outlines, headings and associated content are
;;; treated as "flashcards". Spaced repetition algorithms are used to conduct
;;; interactive "drill sessions", where a selection of these flashcards is
;;; presented to the student in random order. The student rates his or her
;;; recall of each item, and this information is used to schedule the item for
;;; later revision.
;;;
;;; Each drill session can be restricted to topics in the current buffer
;;; (default), one or several files, all agenda files, or a subtree. A single
;;; topic can also be tested.
;;;
;;; Different "card types" can be defined, which present their information to
;;; the student in different ways.
;;;
;;; See the file README.org for more detailed documentation.
